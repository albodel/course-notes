The variance of one sample ($N=1$) is essentially meaningless because it is always equal to zero, no matter what the value of the sample is. In this case, there are no degrees of freedom. Calculating the variance/standard deviation with $N-1$ in the denominator is called the __unbiased__ estimate of the true standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n",

The standard error can thought of as the standard deviation of $(\\bar{x} - \\mu)$, after many repeated experiments with $N$ samples. This assumes that the data are normally distributed.\n",
