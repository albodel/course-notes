In FirstPlot.ipynb, data from an ADCP near Hopkins Marine Station were loaded in and preliminary plots 
were created. This ADCP was located at: 36.621850, -121.898647

This file loads in a data file called: 'doi_10.6085_AA_HMS001_020ADCP019R00_20091216.40.1.txt'

Pre-preliminary plots were made to visualize ranges of data, but code was commented out to speed up run time of Jupyter notebook.

Height above ADCP (m), Year Day, northward velocities in m/s (negative values represent southward velocities),
eastward velocities in m/s (negative values represent westward velocities), and intensity of backscatter in RDI counts 
(average of all 4 beams, rounded to the nearest whole number), were plotted in psuedo color plots. 



For my class project I am interested in compiling several ADCP and buoy data sets of water velocity to characterize typical
seasonal velocities. I would also be interested in looking at land based weather station data for wind information to estimate
wave heights and depth the wave energy would affect the water column/ bottom in the nearshore which could help predict when a 
lot of sediment would be in the water. Finally, I am interested in learning more about what backscatter intensity from ADCPs can
tell me aboutthe amount of sediment in the water column.

My goal for this semester is to have an understanding of the kind of forces affecting sediments on beaches and in the 
nearshore as well as typical water velocities along my thesis study sites. I would also like to learn away to display this kind of
information in an informative way (on a map?) that could be associated with surveys of beach and nearshore surfaces & eventually
compare wave energy and currents to volume changes in pocket beaches on the northern Monterey Peninsula.
